          My name is Dino, and I come from a small but beautiful town in Croatia
          called Ilok. At the moment, I live in Germany in the city of
          Mönchengladbach. In my free time (as you can probably see in the
          picture), I play the guitar. I started playing when I was 13. Mostly,
          I play and listen to rock and hair metal music from the '80s and
          admire amazing bands like Whitesnake, Poison, Ratt, Europe, Iron
          Maiden, and many more. I'm also in love with aviation. Simply put,
          aircraft fascinate me, and maybe one day I will eventually become the
          captain of my favorite aircraft, the Airbus A320. I also enjoy playing
          games like Microsoft Flight Simulator (of course) and Red Dead
          Redemption 2

          After graduating from college and obtaining my bachelor's degree, I
          started my internship at the City Council in my hometown. I worked as
          an Accounting Intern for a year. In this role, I was responsible for
          various administrative tasks, such as collecting information about
          people in need of social assistance and organizing it in Excel.
          Additionally, I handled accounting duties, including posting,
          maintaining vendor and customer data, and executing payments.
          Following my internship, I moved to Slovakia to pursue my master's
          degree and took on a position as a junior accounts payable accountant
          at Deutsche Telekom Services Europe. There, I managed postings,
          executed payments, and sent payment reminders. After a year with DTSE,
          I decided to relocate to Germany to gain more valuable experience. I
          joined Arlanxeo G.m.b.H, where I learned a great deal under the
          guidance of my exceptional supervisor, who practically mentored me
          professionally. Unfortunately, we parted ways after two years, and I
          secured another job where I worked for almost six months. Realizing
          that accountancy no longer inspired me, I decided to make a career
          change.

          I graduated from high school in a city called Vukovar, just 30 km away
          from my hometown. I also graduated from Polytechnics Lavoslav Ružička
          in Vukovar, with a study program in Commerce. With the exceptional
          help of my dear mentor Sandra Mrvica Madjarac, PhD, I managed to
          defend my bachelor thesis with a grade of 5, which is the maximum
          grade in Croatia. After that, I discovered that the Slovakian
          government offers scholarships to study in their country. I applied
          and was accepted. I decided to pursue my master's degree in Bratislava
          at the Economic University, with a study program in International
          Commerce. Fortunately, I also had an amazing mentor there, L'ubos
          Pavelka, Assoc. Prof. Dipl. Ing., PhD, who helped me a lot to defend
          my master thesis with the maximum grade, labeled with the letter A in
          Slovakia.
