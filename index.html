    <!-- ABOUT ME SECTION -->

    <p class="b4"> My name is Dino, and I come from a small but beautiful town in Croatia called Ilok. At the moment, 
        I live in Germany in the city of Mönchengladbach. In my free time (as you can probably see in the 
        picture), I play the guitar. I started playing when I was 13. Mostly, I play and listen to rock 
        and hair metal music from the '80s and admire amazing bands like Whitesnake, Poison, Ratt, Europe,
         Iron Maiden, and many more. I'm also in love with aviation. Simply put, aircraft fascinate me, 
         and maybe one day I will eventually become the captain of my favorite aircraft, the Airbus A320. 
         I also enjoy playing games like Microsoft Flight Simulator (of course) and Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>


    <!-- EXPERIANCE SECTION -->

    <p class="b5"> After graduating from college and obtaining my bachelor's degree, I started my internship at the 
        City Council in my hometown. I worked as an Accounting Intern for a year. In this role, I was 
        responsible for various administrative tasks, such as collecting information about people in need 
        of social assistance and organizing it in Excel. Additionally, I handled accounting duties, 
        including posting, maintaining vendor and customer data, and executing payments. Following my 
        internship, I moved to Slovakia to pursue my master's degree and took on a position as a junior 
        accounts payable accountant at Deutsche Telekom Services Europe. There, I managed postings, 
        executed payments, and sent payment reminders. After a year with DTSE, I decided to relocate 
        to Germany to gain more valuable experience. I joined Arlanxeo G.m.b.H, where I learned a lot 
        under the guidance of my exceptional supervisor Efthimios Feidas, who practically mentored me
         professionally. Unfortunately, we parted ways after two years, and I secured another job where
        I worked for almost six months. Realizing that accountancy no longer inspired me, I decided to 
        make a career change. Currently, I am undergoing re-qualification to become a System and Cyber
        Security Administrator. In short, I am striving to transition into the IT field.</p>


    
    <!-- EDUCATION ME SECTION -->

    <p class="b6"> I graduated from high school in a city called Vukovar, just 30 km away from my hometown. I also
        graduated from Polytechnics Lavoslav Ružička in Vukovar, with a study program in Commerce. 
        With the exceptional help of my dear mentor Sandra Mrvica Madjarac, PhD, I managed to defend 
        my bachelor thesis with a grade of 5 (If you are interested you can find summary 
        <a class="thesis-link" href="Summary_BC.pdf" target="_blank">HERE </a>), 
        which is the maximum grade in Croatia. After that, I discovered that the Slovakian government 
        offers scholarships to study in their country. I applied and was accepted. I decided to pursue
        my master's degree in Bratislava at the Economic University, with a study program in 
        International Commerce. Fortunately, I also had an amazing mentor there, L'ubos Pavelka, 
        Assoc. Prof. Dipl. Ing., PhD, who helped me a lot to defend my master thesis 
        (If you are interested you can find summary 
        <a class="thesis-link" href="Summary_Ing.pdf" target="_blank">HERE </a>), with the maximum grade, 
        labeled with the letter A in Slovakia.</p>
